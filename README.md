Repository for "Comparison of Water Activity Models for Carbohydrate and Amino Acid Solutions"
==============================================================================================

Stored here are the files comprising the data and source code utilised in the
article "Comparison of Water Activity Models for Carbohydrate and Amino Acid
Solutions".

The Project
-----------

This repository is organized in two parts: water activity data from the
literature and the source code of two programs, responsible for the conversion of
data from several properties to water activity and the regression analysis of the
application of each model to the converted data.

The data are spread over two directories: `data/converted/` stores data suitable
for analysis and `data/originals/` stores the original data, as seen in the
literature. Besides, to analyse the effects of a few differences among the data
(as chemical nature, dilution, number of solutes, *etc*), they are listed in the
files stored in `data/lists/`.

The code compiles to two command-line utilities: `ConvertWaterActivity` can be used
for conversion from literature data to data suitable to be fed to `FitWaterActivity`,
which fits the models to the data.

This project links the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) to perform nonlinear
least-squares fitting.

Installation
------------

To utilise the command-line utilities written, one needs to install the
dependencies, clone this repository and compile the source code within.

The installation of the GNU Scientific Library is required. Instructions
are available in the [project's website](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/).

Besides, one needs to install Git, GCC, Make and the libraries BLAS/CBLAS.

Afterwards, one needs only to clone this repository and compile the source:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/thermodynamicsvirtuallab/aw-models
$ cd aw-models
$ make
```
Both utilities will be available in the subdirectory `bin/`.

To simply obtain the data sets analysed, one needs only to clone the repository,
and they will be stored in the subdirectory `data/`; the previous requirements
are no longer needed.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/thermodynamicsvirtuallab/aw-models
$ cd aw-models/data
```

Use
---

To run the utilities, one needs to consider a few details. Firstly, among the
experimental data in the files passed to the program, no conditions in which
the osmotic coefficient is undefined can be included. For instance, pure water
(water activity and molar fraction of one) must be excluded.

Besides, the utilities assume that the files are spreadsheets in `.csv` format,
in which the first line stores the names of each solute in the mixture, the first
column in the lines following it stores water activity values and the other columns
store, for each solute, its molar fraction, as shown below:

```
aw,first_solute,second_solute,...
0.99,0.006,0.004,...
0.97,0.015,0.022,...
0.88,0.123,0.045,...
...
```

To fit the models to the data through `FitWaterActivity` the data are required to
be stored as shown above, as relations between water activity and molar fraction.
Otherwise, one needs to convert them to the suitable format, through the utility
`ConvertWaterActivity`. Both utilities shall be available in the subdirectory
`bin/`, after compilation. For more information, one might be interested in the
user manual shown through the help option `-h`:

```
$ ./bin/ConvertWaterActivity -h
$ ./bin/FitWaterActivity -h
```

Two `bash` scripts, dependent on GNU Datamash, can be run to obtain the results as
shown in the report. They may be, respectively, run through the commands below:

```
$ ./src/gen_data_and_print_table
$ ./src/test_and_train
```
